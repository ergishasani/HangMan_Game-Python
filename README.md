# Hangman Python Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words and prompts the player to guess letters in order to uncover the word. The player has a limited number of attempts before the game ends.

## Files:

1. **Main.py**: This file contains the main game logic, including the word selection, user input, and game outcome determination. It utilizes the `HangMan_Words.py` file to access the list of words and the `HangMan_Art.py` file to display ASCII art representing the hangman's state.

2. **HangMan_Words.py**: This file contains a list of words that the game can randomly select from. The list includes a variety of words for an engaging gameplay experience.

3. **HangMan_Art.py**: This file contains ASCII art representing the hangman's state at different stages of the game. It provides visual feedback to the player as they make incorrect guesses.

## How to Play:

1. Run the `Main.py` file in a Python environment.
2. The game will display ASCII art representing the hangman and prompt you to guess a letter.
3. Enter a letter and press Enter.
4. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If it's incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either uncover the word or run out of attempts.

Have fun playing Hangman!
